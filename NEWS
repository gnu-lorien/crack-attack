v 1.1.15-cvs
  - Fixed #13163 in which the process never terminates if it exits
    unexpectedly.  Need to add fix to the glade file, move fix from gui_main
    to interface implicitly.
  - Updated to work with freeglut 2.4.0. We now call glutInit().
  - Uses ENet for networking backend. This should get considerable speedups
    because it's UDP
  - Better Windows install script. (Thanks Till Schuberth)
  - Added --enable-more-warnings for those that want to test things out.
    Code borrowed from Nautilus, suggested by davyd.

v 1.1.14
  - Some fixes to the build system. (Thanks Mike Frysinger)
  - Sound and music patches. (Thanks Mike Frysinger and Miguel Ángel Vilela
    García). These are currently unsupported, so good luck figuring out how to
    use them.
  - Totally redesigned GUI.
  - Fixes Savannah bugs #12832, #12915
  - Fixes the level lights when playing against the AI on Windows
  - Bumped the networking version to 1.1.14. Essentially, we messed up
    compatibility somewhere. Considering that we're planning on redoing
    networking in the next release, a bumb seemed the most appropriate. Please
    update to the latest version.

v 1.1.13
  - Implemented binary relocatability
  - Many changes to the source code to make it compatible with Windows using
    dev-cpp.
  - Many code cleanups to take care of warnings.
  - Fixed stones hanging in mid-air (Thanks Wolfgang Klier <stubai>)
   - Fixes Savannah bug #10988
  - Added a command-line switch to change the resolution --res.

v 1.1.12
  - idlePlay now sleeps to prevent 100% CPU usage. (Thanks Dennis Lubert)
   - Something about the way this works irks me. I'd like to see a way for
     this to work by using glut calls to get the elapsed time. My attempts at
     this were incorrect, so I'll stick with what Dennis wrote.
   - Fixes Debian bug #159241
  - Really Low Graphics (Thanks Stephan Beyer)
   - FIXME: Displayer.cxx needs to unmask drawWinRecord and just make the win
     record less graphics intensive.
  - Fix for a crasher when using high quality graphics on certain boards. This
    fix has been in some distros for a while, but is new to this patchset.
   - Fixes Gentoo bug #53320
   - Fixes Debian bug #245157
  - Change protocol numbering to make this release compatible with Windows
    version which is still 1.1.8.
  - Name, resolution, and graphics settings are now remembered by the GUI.

v 1.1.11
  - Networking component sends a different version number now. This version 
    number will only increase when we change the networking code.
  - gtk+-2.0 front-end
  - gcc-3.4 build fixes
  - NVidia OpenGL build fixes. The error was in how we used deprecated
    extensions. I'm sure this bug would come up other places, but NVidia seemed
    to be the driver that was causing the most problems

v 1.1.10
  - Patch to prevent crash on Voodoo3 cards (thanks to Olivier Blin).
  - Fix of busy-port bug after net games (thanks to Guillaume Cottenceau).

v 1.1.9
  - Removed uses of deprecated ostrstream.
  - Updated old C-style header file names.
  - Defined GL_GLEXT_LEGACY to make multitexturing code compatable with modern
    OpenGL (thanks to Mark Wilde).

v 1.1.8
  - Reduced network load by reducing garbage queue length and communication
    frequency.
  - Added workaround to GLUT bug which caused a crash when the Del-key was
    pressed after the game in solo play (thanks to Stephen Thorne).
  - Added a low resolution graphics mode (thanks to Stephen Thorne).
  - Improved the window size algorithm.
  - Improved the socket closing procedures.
  - Modified the idle callback's behavior when behind in time steps.

v 1.1.7
  - Some debug switches left on in 1.1.6.  Poor quality control!
  - Added check for version compatibility in communication code.

v 1.1.6
  - Fixed a bug which caused the tens and higher score digits to fade
    improperly.
  - Fixed a variable type problem which caused a compilation error with some
    compilers.
  - Modified the distribution of special blocks in X-treme mode.
  - Improved communication and game code so that players know as soon as
    possible that they have lost.
  - Improved communication code, halving turn around time on state messages.
  - Added a status bar which displays how close the player is to losing.

v 1.1.5
  - Fixed a small combo management bug.
  - Changed the point system of solo play to a more fun and intuitive algorithm.
  - Changed the way arrays were being deleted, which was causing crashes under
    Windows.

v 1.1.4
  - Compiles under Visual C++ 6.0 and runs under Windows.
  - Created a Visual Basic front end for Windows.
  - Created a Windows installation script using NSIS.
  - Fixed several misuses of GL_BLEND texture blend mode, which caused wrongly
    colored signs under certain drivers.
  - Turned off lightmap texturing when rendering waking garbage, which caused
    waking garbage to be dark under certain drivers.

v 1.1.3
  - Removed use of deprecated members of strstream.  Now compiles under
    libstdc++-v3.

v 1.1.2
  - Restructured and started using automake/autoconf.

v 1.1.1
  - Added point system to solo play.
  - Switched solo play to single game.
  - Added score record storage and display.
  - Improved creep speed algorithm.

v 1.1.0
  - Fixed a bug which caused the loading of the logo as a garbage texture to
    fail.
  - Player name now defaults to username (thanks to Colin Walters).
  - Fixed big/little-endian bug in communication code (thanks to Colin Walters).
  - Moved dynamic data files to .crack-attack directory.
