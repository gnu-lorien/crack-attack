.SH DESCRIPTION
Crack Attack is roughly based on the Super Nintendo game
"Tetris Attack"\&. Slowly, your stack of colored blocks grows from the
bottom, and you\&'ve got to make sure it never reaches the top\&. If it
does, you lose\&. To eliminate blocks from the stack, line up at least
three of one color, horizontally or vertically\&. Once you do, those
blocks disappear, and put off slightly your inevitable demise\&.
.PP
Crack Attack essentially requires hardware acceleration\&. For
XFree users, this means you want DRI\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fBsolo\fR
Creates a solo game versus yourself\&. The goal is to 
gain as many points as possible\&. If an AI level is specified, then 
the game is played versus a computer and the goal is to defeat the 
computer player in as little time as possible\&.
